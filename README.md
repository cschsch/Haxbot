# Haxbot

Haxbot is a library using Puppeteer to communicate with Haxball's (https://www.haxball.com/) headless API to create a room and record each game's result.

For recording (and querying) purposes Entity Framework is being used in conjunction with a SQLite database.


# CLI

To use Haxbot, there is a command line tool for querying, and for room creation purposes.
It contains a plethora of options and a help command for each action you can take.
